# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### Lumen + MongoDB codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully functional REST API built with **Lumen + MongoDB**, including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

It borrows heavily from the excellent Laravel implementation by ...: https://github.com/gothinkster/laravel-realworld-example-app

For more information on how this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

# Getting started

## Installation

Please check the official Lumen installation guide for server requirements before you start. [Official Documentation](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs/5.5/installation)


Clone the repository

    git clone git@github.com:elcobvg/lumen-realworld-example-app.git

Switch to the repo folder

    cd lumen-realworld-example-app

Install all the dependencies using composer

    composer install

Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file

    cp .env.example .env

Generate a new application key

    php artisan key:generate

Generate a new JWT authentication secret key

    php artisan jwt:generate

Run the database migrations (**Set the database connection in .env before migrating**)

    php artisan migrate

Start the local development server

    php artisan serve

You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000

**TL;DR command list**

    git clone git@elcobvg/lumen-realworld-example-app.git
    cd lumen-realworld-example-app
    composer install
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    php artisan jwt:generate 
    
**Make sure you set the correct database connection information before running the migrations** [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

    php artisan migrate
    php artisan serve

## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes users, articles, comments, tags, favorites and follows. This can help you to quickly start testing the api or couple a frontend and start using it with ready content.**

Run the database seeder and you're done

    php artisan db:seed

***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

    php artisan migrate:refresh

## API Specification

This application adheres to the api specifications set by the [Thinkster](https://github.com/gothinkster) team. This helps mix and match any backend with any other frontend without conflicts.

# Testing API

Run the Lumen development server

    php -S localhost:8000 -t public

The api can now be accessed at

    http://localhost:8000/api

Request headers

| **Required** 	| **Key**              	| **Value**            	|
|----------	|------------------	|------------------	|
| Yes      	| Content-Type     	| application/json 	|
| Yes      	| X-Requested-With 	| XMLHttpRequest   	|
| Optional 	| Authorization    	| Token {JWT}      	|

Refer the [api specification](#api-specification) for more info.

----------
 
# Authentication
 
This applications uses JSON Web Token (JWT) to handle authentication. The token is passed with each request using the `Authorization` header with `Token` scheme. The JWT authentication middleware handles the validation and authentication of the token. Please check the following sources to learn more about JWT.
 
- https://jwt.io/introduction/
- https://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html

----------

# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
 
This applications has CORS enabled by default on all API endpoints. The default configuration allows requests from `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:4200` to help speed up your frontend testing. The CORS allowed origins can be changed by setting them in the config file. Please check the following sources to learn more about CORS.
